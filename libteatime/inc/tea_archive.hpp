/*

constraints:
 - must be able to go to next and previous entry
 - must be able to stream file from disk (duh)
 - possible checkpoint system? (see below)
 
checkpoints:
for compressed archive entries, it might be good to have a way to create a checkpoint of sorts, so that you can always go back to that part in the file without having to re-read from the start
